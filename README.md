## Scrapin' With Mongo
***
### Mongo News Scraper App

This application scrapes articles from the NPR News homepage and displays the headline, image, and summary on the application's home page. If the "Scrape New Articles" button is pressed, the application will scrape any new articles that have been published on the NPR News site, and populate them on the home screen. Clicking on the article headline will open that article in a new window. 

The user has the option of saving articles, which will remove the article from the "Home" page and save it on the "Saved Articles" page, until removed. On the "Saved Articles" page, the user has the option of deleting the article, which will remove it from the saved page and repopulate it on the home page. The user can also add notes to the article.
